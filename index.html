I am currently a research assistant at in the department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at Princeton University, where I work on Southern Ocean upwelling pathways in Dr. Jorge Sarmiento's Biogeochemistry group. Under the mentorship of Adele Morrison, Steve Griffies, and Alison Gray, I use Lagrangian and Eulerian diagnostics to uncover the three-dimensional structure of Southern Ocean deep water upwelling pathways using both models (GFDL's CM2 suite of Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Models) and observations (ARGO floats). I am particularly interested in the role of eddies on these upwelling pathways and methods for diagnosing their effects. </p>

<p align="justify"> For most of my actual time spent on research, I work on advancing existing methods for advecting Lagrangian water parcels (representing - either approximately or exactly, depending on the methods - water mass fluxes) using gridded time-varying velocity fields as well as developing novel methods for analysing the large sets of output trajectories (<var>O(10<sup>6</sup>)</var> trajectories containing <var>O(10<sup>3</sup>)</var> snapshots in time).

<h2> Other Interests </h2>

<p align="justify"> I am currently spending most of my free time on applying to graduate school (Princeton University, EAPS at MIT, MIT/WHOI joint program, Scripps Institute of Oceanography, University of Washington) and immersing myself in as much of the literature on Climate Dynamics (both the dynamics of the ocean "alone" and the coupled climate system) as possible.</p>

<p align="justify"> In order to read the obscene number of papers I want to read in the coming year, I am working on starting a podcast on Climate Dynamics geared towards scientifically-minded High School students and Undergraduates interested in studying how the climate system works. From my own experience looking for earth science podcasts, they are either directed at the general public such as NPR's Radiolab (with little to not actual scientific substance) or are very dense dissections of the literature. My plan is to combine the two, started from a general introduction to a topic in Climate Dynamics to an in-depth interview of a graduate student currently working on the topic. </p>

<p align="justify"> While an undergraduate at Haverford College, I also founded the League of Legends club, of which I was an avid President, team captain, and coach. I reached a peak of a "Diamond" rating in the game and have followed the professional league closely. Time-permitting, I hope to continue following League of Legends Esports and possibly consult as an analyst to high-ranking teams.
