<h2> Current Research </h2>
<p align="justify"> 
<img src="henridrakemaps.jpg" alt="Henri Drake reading a topographic map" style="float:right;width:365px;height:356px;margin: 0px 20px">

I am currently a <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/aos/people/research_staff/drake/index.xml">research assistant</a> in the department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (<a href="https://www.princeton.edu/aos/"><abbr title="Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences">AOS</abbr></a>) at Princeton University, where I work on Southern Ocean upwelling pathways in Prof. <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/aos/people/faculty/jorge_sarmiento/">Jorge Sarmiento</a>'s Biogeochemistry group. Under the mentorship of Princeton postdoc <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/aos/people/research_staff/morrison/index.xml">Adele Morrison</a>, Princeton postdoc <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~argray/">Alison Gray</a> and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (<a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/"<abbr title="Geophysical Fluid Laboratory">GFDL</abbr></a>) physical scientist <a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/stephen-griffies-homepage">Steve Griffies</a>, I use Lagrangian and Eulerian diagnostics to uncover the three-dimensional structure of Southern Ocean deep water upwelling pathways using both models (GFDL's CM2 suite of Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Models) and observations (<a href="http://www.argo.ucsd.edu/">Argo</a> floats). I am particularly interested in the role of eddies on these upwelling pathways and methods for diagnosing their effects. </p>

<p align="justify"> For most of my actual time spent on research, I work on advancing existing methods for advecting Lagrangian water parcels (representing - either approximately or exactly, depending on the methods - water mass fluxes) using gridded time-varying velocity fields as well as developing novel methods for analysing the large sets of output trajectories (<var>O(10<sup>6</sup>)</var> trajectories containing <var>O(10<sup>3</sup>)</var> snapshots in time).

<h2> Personal and Academic Background</h2>

I lived near the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/prsf/index.htm">Presidio</a> in San Francisco until I moved to the East Coast for my undergraduate studies at <a href="http://www.haverford.edu">Haverford College</a>. There, I focused on Physics and Mathematics, dabbling in the few Environmental Science and Scientific Computing courses that seemed relevant to interests in climate modeling. During my three undergraduate summer breaks, I did research in an Environmental Engineering / Remote Sensing laboratory under Prof. <a href="http://www.clarkson.edu/cee/faculty/bonner.html">James Bonner</a> at Clarkson University, in a Quantum Computing laboratory under Prof. <a href="http://ee.usc.edu/faculty_staff/faculty_directory/lidar.htm">Daniel Lidar</a> at the University of Southern California, and in the mathematical theory of knots under Prof. <a href="https://www.haverford.edu/users/jsabloff">Joshua Sabloff</a> at Haverford College.

<h2> Prospective Graduate Student </h2>

<p align="justify"> I currently spend most of my free time working on my graduate school applications to Princeton University Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences; Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Massachusetts Institute of Technology / Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute Joint Program in Oceanography; University of Washington Atmospheric Science; University of Washington School of Oceanography) and immersing myself in as much of the literature on climate physics as possible, focusing on ocean physics for the time being. I will be working at Princeton University until 06/15/2016 and searching for something interesting (and different) to work on during the summer before (hopefully) starting graduate school.</p>

<h2> Publications </h2>

<h2> Collaborators </h2>
I am currently in close collaboration with Prof. Jorge Sarmiento (Princeton University), postdoc Adele Morrison (Princeton University), postdoc Alison Gray (Princeton University), and physical scientist Stephen Griffies (GFDL / Princeton University) on my principal research projects. I am also contributing to a review paper on Lagrangian Ocean Analysis with Prof. Erik van Sebille and many others (incl. Prof. Bruno Blanke and Prof. Kristopher Döös), resulting from a workshop at Imperial College London (09/2015). <br><br><br>
