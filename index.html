<h2> Current Research </h2>
<p align="justify"> 
<img src="henridrakemaps.jpg" alt="Henri Drake reading a topographic map" style="float:right;width:365px;height:356px;margin: 0px 20px">

I am currently a <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/aos/people/research_staff/drake/index.xml">research assistant</a> in the department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (<a href="https://www.princeton.edu/aos/"><abbr title="Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences">AOS</abbr></a>) at Princeton University, where I work on Southern Ocean upwelling pathways in Prof. <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/aos/people/faculty/jorge_sarmiento/">Jorge Sarmiento</a>'s Biogeochemistry group. Under the mentorship of Princeton postdoc <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/aos/people/research_staff/morrison/index.xml">Adele Morrison</a>, Princeton postdoc <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~argray/">Alison Gray</a> and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (<a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/"<abbr title="Geophysical Fluid Laboratory">GFDL</abbr></a>) physical scientist <a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/stephen-griffies-homepage">Steve Griffies</a>, I use Lagrangian and Eulerian diagnostics to uncover the three-dimensional structure of Southern Ocean deep water upwelling pathways using both models (GFDL's CM2 suite of Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Models) and observations (<a href="http://www.argo.ucsd.edu/">Argo</a> floats). I am particularly interested in the role of resolved eddies, paramterized eddies, and zonal topography assymetries on these upwelling pathways and methods for diagnosing their effects. </p>

<h2> Other Academic Interests </h2>

<p align="justify">
Other physical oceanography research problems that interest me are the energy cascade in the ocean (especially with respect to submesoscale energy dissipation), ideals models of the global overturning circulation, and the origin and evolution of mesoscale and submesoscale coherent structures. </p>

<p align="justify"> I also enjoying reading about and discussing research in other fields of earth science such as large-scale atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric turbulence, meteorology, climate change science, climate model development, paleoclimate, exoplanet climates, ocean engineering, environmental science, large-scale ecology, climate model development, and chaos and dynamical systems. </p>

<p align="justify"> Outside of earth science circles, I closely follow the wilderness philosophy including anything from Matsuo Basho's <i>Narrow Road to the Interior</i> to Henry David Thoreau's <i>Walden</i> to John Muir's <i>The Story of My Boyhood and Youth</i> to Gary Snyder's <i>The Practice of the Wild</i>. I am a strong believer in the preservation of American wilderness, whether it be through state / federal park systems or  private land conservation.
 
<h2> Personal and Academic Background</h2>

<p align="justify">
I lived in San Francisco until I moved to the East Coast for my undergraduate studies at <a href="http://www.haverford.edu">Haverford College</a>. There, I focused on Physics and Mathematics, dabbling in the few Environmental Science and Scientific Computing courses that seemed relevant to interests in climate physics. During my three undergraduate summer breaks, I did research in an Environmental Engineering / Remote Sensing laboratory under Prof. <a href="http://www.clarkson.edu/cee/faculty/bonner.html">James Bonner</a> at Clarkson University, in a Quantum Computing laboratory under Prof. <a href="http://ee.usc.edu/faculty_staff/faculty_directory/lidar.htm">Daniel Lidar</a> at the University of Southern California, and in the mathematical theory of knots under Prof. <a href="https://www.haverford.edu/users/jsabloff">Joshua Sabloff</a> at Haverford College. </p>

<h2> Prospective Graduate Student </h2>

<p align="justify"> I have recently submitted applications to the following graduate programs: Princeton University Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences; Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Massachusetts Institute of Technology / Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute Joint Program in Oceanography; University of Washington Atmospheric Science; University of Washington School of Oceanography. I will be working at Princeton University until 06/15/2016 and searching for something interesting (and different) to work on during the summer before (hopefully) starting graduate school.</p>

<h2> Publications </h2>

<h2> Collaborators </h2>
I am currently in close collaboration with Prof. Jorge Sarmiento (Princeton University), postdoc Adele Morrison (Princeton University), postdoc Alison Gray (Princeton University), and physical scientist Stephen Griffies (GFDL / Princeton University) on my principal research projects. I am also contributing to a review paper on Lagrangian Ocean Analysis with Prof. Erik van Sebille and many others (incl. Prof. Bruno Blanke and Prof. Kristopher Döös), resulting from a workshop at Imperial College London (09/2015). <br><br><br>
