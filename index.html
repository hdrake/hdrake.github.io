<h2> Current Research </h2>

<p align="justify"> 

I am currently a <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/aos/people/research_staff/drake/index.xml">research assistant</a> in the department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (<a href="https://www.princeton.edu/aos/"><abbr title="Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences">AOS</abbr></a>) at Princeton University, where I work on Southern Ocean upwelling pathways in Professor <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/aos/people/faculty/jorge_sarmiento/">Jorge Sarmiento</a>'s Biogeochemistry group. Under the mentorship of Princeton University postdoc <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/aos/people/research_staff/morrison/index.xml">Adele Morrison</a>, Princeton University postdoc <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~argray/">Alison Gray</a> and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (<a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/"<abbr title="Geophysical Fluid Laboratory">GFDL</abbr></a>) physical scientist <a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/stephen-griffies-homepage">Steve Griffies</a>, I use Lagrangian and Eulerian diagnostics to uncover the three-dimensional structure of Southern Ocean deep water upwelling pathways using both models (GFDL's CM2 suite of Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Models) and observations (<a href="http://www.argo.ucsd.edu/">Argo</a> floats). I am particularly interested in the role of resolved eddies, paramterized eddies, and zonal topography assymetries on these upwelling pathways and methods for diagnosing their effects. </p>

<h2> Other Academic Interests </h2>

<p align="justify">
Other physical oceanography research problems that interest me are the energy cascade in the ocean (especially with respect to submesoscale energy dissipation), ideal models of the global overturning circulation, and the origin and evolution of mesoscale and submesoscale coherent structures. </p>

<p align="justify"> I also enjoying reading about and discussing research in other fields of earth science such as large-scale atmospheric dynamics, atmospheric turbulence, meteorology, climate change science, climate model development, paleoclimate, exoplanet climates, ocean engineering, environmental science, large-scale ecology, climate model development, and chaos and dynamical systems. </p>

<p align="justify"> Outside of earth science circles, I enjoy wilderness philosophy including anything from Matsuo Basho's <i>Narrow Road to the Interior</i> to Henry David Thoreau's <i>Walden</i> to John Muir's <i>The Story of My Boyhood and Youth</i> to Gary Snyder's <i>The Practice of the Wild</i>. I am a strong believer in the preservation of American wilderness, whether it be through state / federal park systems or  private land conservation.

<h2> Prospective Graduate Student </h2>

<p align="justify"> I have recently submitted applications to the following graduate programs: Princeton University Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences; Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Massachusetts Institute of Technology / Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute Joint Program in Oceanography; University of Washington Atmospheric Science; University of Washington School of Oceanography. I will be working at Princeton University until 06/15/2016 and searching for something interesting (and different) to work on during the summer before (hopefully) starting graduate school.</p>

<h2> Publications </h2>
Coming soon?

<h2> Collaborators </h2>
<p align="justify">
For my principal research projects, I collaborate with Princeton University (PU) Professor Jorge Sarmiento, PU postdoc Adele Morrison, PU postdoc Alison Gray,  Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) research scientist Wilbert Weijer, and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) physical scientist Stephen Griffies on my principal research projects. I am also contributing to a review paper on Lagrangian Ocean Analysis with Imperial College London (ICL) Professor Erik van Sebille and others, resulting from a workshop at ICL (09/2015). </p>

<h2> Personal and Academic Background</h2>

<p align="justify">
I grew up in San Francisco, where I attending the French American International School (k-12). After graduating from high school, I moved to the East Coast for my undergraduate studies at <a href="http://www.haverford.edu">Haverford College</a> near Philadelphia. There, I focused on Physics and Mathematics, dabbling here and there in the few Environmental Science and Scientific Computing courses that seemed relevant to my interests in climate physics. During my three undergraduate summer breaks, I did research in an Environmental Engineering / Remote Sensing laboratory under Professor <a href="http://www.clarkson.edu/cee/faculty/bonner.html">James Bonner</a> at Clarkson University, in a Quantum Computing laboratory under Professor <a href="http://ee.usc.edu/faculty_staff/faculty_directory/lidar.htm">Daniel Lidar</a> at the University of Southern California, and in the mathematical theory of knots under Professor <a href="https://www.haverford.edu/users/jsabloff">Joshua Sabloff</a> at Haverford College. </p>

<h2> Non-academic Interests </h2>
<p align="justify">
Outside of academics, I enjoy running (typically 30-60 miles a week), hiking (especially long backpacking trips in the mountains with friends), finding exciting new ways to stay vegan, watching professional League of Legends (real time strategy computer game), and skateboarding (weather permitting). </p>
