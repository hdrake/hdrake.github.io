<h2> Research </h2>
<p align="justify"> 
<img src="henridrakemaps.jpg" alt="Henri Drake reading a topographic map" style="float:right;width:365px;height:356px;margin: 0px 20px">

I am currently a <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/aos/people/research_staff/drake/index.xml">research assistant</a> in the department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (<abbr title="Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences">AOS</abbr>) at Princeton University, where I work on Southern Ocean upwelling pathways in Prof. <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/aos/people/faculty/jorge_sarmiento/">Jorge Sarmiento</a>'s Biogeochemistry group. Under the mentorship of Princeton postdoc Adele Morrison, Princeton postdoc Alison Gray and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (<abbr title="Geophysical Fluid Laboratory">GFDL</abbr>) physical scientist Steve Griffies, I use Lagrangian and Eulerian diagnostics to uncover the three-dimensional structure of Southern Ocean deep water upwelling pathways using both models (GFDL's CM2 suite of Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Models) and observations (Argo floats). I am particularly interested in the role of eddies on these upwelling pathways and methods for diagnosing their effects. </p>

<p align="justify"> For most of my actual time spent on research, I work on advancing existing methods for advecting Lagrangian water parcels (representing - either approximately or exactly, depending on the methods - water mass fluxes) using gridded time-varying velocity fields as well as developing novel methods for analysing the large sets of output trajectories (<var>O(10<sup>6</sup>)</var> trajectories containing <var>O(10<sup>3</sup>)</var> snapshots in time).

<h2> Prospective Graduate Student </h2>

<p align="justify"> I am currently spending most of my free time on applying to graduate school (Princeton University Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences; Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Massachusetts Institute of Technology / Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute Joint Program in Oceanography; University of Washington Atmospheric Science; University of Washington School of Oceanography) and immersing myself in as much of the literature on climate physics as possible, focusing on ocean physics for the time being. I will be working at Princeton University until 06/15/2016 and searching for something interesting (and different) to work on during the summer before (hopefully) starting graduate school.</p>

<h2> Publications </h2>
<h3> In Preparation </h3>

<h2> Collaborators </h2>
I am currently in close collaboration with Prof. Jorge Sarmiento (Princeton University), postdoc Adele Morrison (Princeton University), postdoc Alison Gray (Princeton University), and physical scientist Stephen Griffies (GFDL / Princeton University) on my principal research projects. I am also contributing to a review paper on Lagrangian Ocean Analysis with Prof. Erik van Sebille and many others (incl. Prof. Bruno Blanke and Prof. Kristopher Döös), resulting from a workshop at Imperial College London (09/2015).

<h2> Other Interests </h2>

<p align="justify"> I am currently spending most of my free time on applying to graduate school (Princeton University Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences; Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Massachusetts Institute of Technology / Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute Joint Program in Oceanography; University of Washington Atmospheric Science; University of Washington School of Oceanography) and immersing myself in as much of the literature on Climate Dynamics (both the dynamics of the ocean "alone" and the coupled climate system) as possible. I will be working at Princeton University until 06/15/2016 and searching for something interesting (and different) to work on during the summer before (hopefully) starting graduate school.</p>

<p align="justify"> While an undergraduate at Haverford College, I also founded the League of Legends club, of which I was an avid President, team captain, and coach. I reached a peak of a "Diamond" rating in the game and have followed the professional league closely. Time-permitting, I hope to continue following League of Legends Esports and possibly consult as an analyst to high-ranking teams. </p>
