	<p id="demo"> My research aims at understanding how the deepest and oldest waters of the ocean, the abyssal waters, make their way back to the surface. For decades, oceanographers have known where the abyssal waters come from. When surface waters become cold and salty in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, they become denser than the surrounding waters and sink to the bottom of the Ocean. Dense waters also form in the North Atlantic, though they are not quite as dense as Antarctic Bottom Waters so they fill the deep waters above the abyssal ocean. Since the volume of water in the ocean is conserved, the same amount of water sinking at the poles must be rising elsewhere. It is still unclear exactly where, how, and why these waters come back to the surface. Our current understanding is that Antarctic abyssal waters fill the global Ocean abyss and mix with the deep waters above on millenial timescales. Once these waters are mixed into light enough waters, they are swept southward into the Southern Ocean along surfaces of constant density (isopycnals). In the land-free latitude of Drake Passage, the world's strongest surface winds drive the world's strongest current, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The winds drive surface waters on their northern flank to the north and surface waters on their southern flank to the south. This divergence in the transport of surface waters causes deep waters, originating from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, to be drawn to the surface. My previous research at Princeton University describes the processes that bring deep waters to the surface of the Southern Ocean. My current research as part of the MIT / WHOI Joint Program in Physical Oceanography consists of investigating the mixing-driven transformation of abyssal waters into lighter and shallower deep waters.
