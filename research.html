			<h3>Deep Ocean Turbulence</h3>

			<!-- At the high latitudes of the Arctic and Antarctic, cold and salty (and hence dense) surface waters sink to the bottom of the ocean. Since seawater mass is conserved in the ocean, we know that these abyssal waters must return to the upper ocean elsewhere. For decades, oceanographers theorized that these dense abyssal waters upwelled by mixing vigorously with lighter overlaying deep waters. However, observed ocean mixing increases towards the sea floor, where powerful internal waves break and dissipate their energy (see schematic to the right), rather than towards the surface. Thus, water in the deep interior ocean mixes preferentially with denser waters and results in sinking, not upwelling. Only just above the sea floor, where water can only mix upwards, do we expect ocean mixing to result in upwelling. In my research, I aim to understand how bottom-intensified ocean turbulence brings abyssal waters upwards along continental slopes and ridges. -->
