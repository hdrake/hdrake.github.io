			<h3>Outdoor Interests</h3>
			<p> I enjoy running, hiking, and skateboarding in my free time. I ran varsity for two years at <a href="http://haverfordathletics.com/sports/mxc/index">Haverford College</a> and although I am no longer on a team, I still run in long distance races every few months. I try to run everyday and keep my daily running log at <a href="http://rogger.co/hdrake">rogger.co</a>. I recently hiked 150 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail and hope to complete the entire trail over the course of my life. I've recently reinvigorated my childhood interest in Skateboarding and am working up to landing a kickflip.

			<h3>Indoor Interests</h3>
			<p> I am an avid fan of poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Snyder">Gary Snyder</a>, print-maker <a href="http://tomkillion.com/prints-1/">Tom Killion</a>, and film director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0594503/">Hayao Miyazaki</a>. I hope to one day have an understanding of oceans, winds, and mountains that rivals these three japanese (or "faux-japanese") genius artists.
