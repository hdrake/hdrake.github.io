			<h3>Short biography</h3>
			<p> I grew up in San Francisco, California, where minor earthquakes frequently that interrupted classes first sparked my interest in Earth science. In 7th grade I shadowed a Principal Investigator at the United States Geological Survey and attended a mind-blowing seminar on a statistical method for earthquake prediction. Since that day, I have known that I want to spend the rest of my life researching how the Earth works. However, I always enjoyed the theoretical challenge of mathematics and for years struggled to balance my interest in mathematics with my interest in Earth science. The field of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) was the obvious solution to my conundrum. My dream is to spend the next decade doing fundamental research in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics before hopefully becoming either a NASA astronaut or a university professor.

			<h3>Outdoor Interests</h3>
			<p> I enjoy running, hiking, and skateboarding in my free time. I ran on the varsity team for two years at <a href="http://haverfordathletics.com/sports/mxc/index">Haverford College</a> and although I am no longer on a team, I still run in long distance races every few months. I try to run everyday and keep my daily running log at <a href="http://rogger.co/hdrake">rogger.co</a>. I recently hiked 150 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail and hope to complete the remaining 2250 miles over the coming decade. I also recently reinvigorated my childhood interest in Skateboarding and am working towards landing a kickflip.

			<h3>Indoor Interests</h3>
			<p> I am an avid fan of poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Snyder">Gary Snyder</a>, print-maker <a href="http://tomkillion.com/prints-1/">Tom Killion</a>, and film director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0594503/">Hayao Miyazaki</a>. I hope to one day have an understanding of oceans, winds, and mountains that rivals these three japanese (or "faux-japanese") genius artists. I have yet to go to Japan but I am hopeful that a career in Oceanography will eventually bring me there for a conference or as part of a research cruise.
