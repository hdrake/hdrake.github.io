			<h3> Outdoors </h3>
			<p> When I can have time away from work, I enjoy numerous outdoor activities including running, hiking, and skateboarding. I ran varsity for two years at <a href="http://haverfordathletics.com/sports/mxc/index">Haverford College</a> and although I am no longer on a team, I still run in long distance races every few months. I keep my training log updated daily at <a href="http://rogger.co/hdrake">rogger.co</a>.

			<h3> Art </h3>
			<p> I am an avid fan of poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Snyder">Gary Snyder</a>, print-maker <a href="http://tomkillion.com/prints-1/">Tom Killion</a>, and film director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0594503/">Hayao Miyazaki</a>. These three japanese (or "faux-japanese") artists represent oceans, winds, and mountains with a level of accuracy that scientists can only dream of.
